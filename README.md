# EDA_Exploring-Many-Variables
This repository shows some of the ways of applying R's exploratory data analysis techniques to datasets with multiple variables. It mainly focuses on Facebook user data, but also dips a bit into Dannon Yogurt purchases and Genomic data to make very specific points near the end. 

1. "Multiple_Var_EDA.html" - master doc walking through various techniques for visualizing multivariate data
2. "pseudo_facebook.tsv" - Facebook user data, includes variables like date joined, tenure, gender, number of likes received, etc. 
3. "yogurt.csv" - Dannon yogurt purchases among several households 
4. "nci.tsv" - Genomic data 
5. "Yogurt_Purchases_random_sample.png" and "FBdata_Scatterplot_Matrix.png" - sample plots from dataset
